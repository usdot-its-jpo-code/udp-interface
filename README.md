# UDP Interface

Currently the SDC/SDW stores and distributes Traveler Information Messages (TIMs). The UDP Interface of the mvp SDC/SDW allows users to programmatically receive these TIMS bundled as Advisory Situation Data Distributions. To receive data from this interface, a specific UDP dialog sequence must be followed. The below diagram depicts this sequence.

**Each of these messages are UPER encoded.


### Prerequisites
* JDK 1.8: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
* Git: https://git-scm.com/


### Getting Started

#### Step 1 - Clone this repository
```
git clone <ADD LINK HERE>
```
#### Step 2 - Clone and install dependencies
Follow instructions for cloning and installing the [common-models] and [per-xer-codec] repositories

#### Step 2 - Build the application
```
cd UDPInterface
mvn clean install
```

#### Step 3 - Set Up & Running the Application
Copy the UDPInterface-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar to a desired directory. In this example we will use "runDir"
```
mkdir runDir
cd runDir
cp /target/UDPInterface-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies ./runDir/
```
Copy the native library generated by the building the [per-xer-codec](google.com) **ADD LINK** to runDir. 
```
cp libper-xer-codec.so ./runDir/ 
```
Create config/settings.properties. Sample [settings.properties](src/main/resources/config/settings.properties)
```
mkdir config
nano config/settings.properties
```

Run the application
```
cd ..
java -Djava.library.path=. -jar UDPInterface-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies
```
