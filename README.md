# UDP Interface

US Department of Transportation Joint Program office (JPO) Situation Data Clearinghouse/Situation Data Warehouse MVP (SDC/SDW MVP)

In the context of ITS, the SDC/SDW is a data warehouse and distribution software system that stores data received from the [JPO-ODE](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode) system. This data is persisted for consumption by applications & systems supporting the operation, maintenance, and use of the transportation system, as well as related research and development efforts.

Currently the SDC/SDW stores and distributes Traveler Information Messages (TIMs). The UDP Interface of the mvp SDC/SDW allows users to programmatically receive these TIMS bundled as Advisory Situation Data Distributions. To receive data from this interface, a specific UDP dialog sequence must be followed. The below diagram depicts this sequence.

**Each of these messages are UPER encoded.


### Prerequisites
* JDK 1.8: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
* Git: https://git-scm.com/


### Getting Started

#### Step 2 - Clone this repository
```
git clone <ADD LINK HERE>
```
#### Step 1 - Build the application
```
cd UDPInterface
mvn clean install
```

#### Step 3 - Running the UDP Interface
Copy the UDPInterface-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar to a desired directory. In this example we will use "runDir"
```
cp /target/UDPInterface-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar ./runDir/
```
Copy the native library generated by the building the [per-xer-codec](google.com) **ADD LINK** to runDir. Alternatively a pre-generated native library can be found [here](src/main/resources/)
```
cp libper-xer-codec.so ./runDir/ 
```
Create config/settings.properties. Sample [settings.properties](src/main/resources/config/settings.resources)
```
cd runDir
mkdir config
nano config/settings.properties
```

Run the application
```
java -Djava.library.path=. -jar DialogHandler-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
